Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol that was developed for IP networks and is based on the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm.

OSPF is an interior gateway protocol (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network.

OSPF uses a shortest path first algorithm to build and calculate the shortest path to all destinations. The shortest path is calculated with the Dijkstra algorithm.

Advantages of OSPF :

- With OSPF, there is no limitation on the hop count.
- The intelligent use of VLSM is very useful in IP address allocation.
- OSPF uses IP multicast to send link-state updates. This ensures less process resource consumption on routers that do not listen to OSPF packets. Updates are only sent in case routing changes occur instead of periodically. This ensures efficient bandwidth.
- OSPF has better convergence than RIP. This is because routing changes are propagated instantaneously and not periodically.
- OSPF allows for better load balancing.
- OSPF allows for a logical definition of networks where routers can be divided into areas. This limits the explosion of link state updates over the whole network. This also provides a mechanism to aggregate routes and decrease the unnecessary propagation of subnet information.
- OSPF allows for routing authentication through different methods of password authentication.
- OSPF allows for the transfer and tagging of external routes injected into an Autonomous System. This keeps track of external routes injected by exterior protocols such as BGP.
